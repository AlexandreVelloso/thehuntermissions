## Common issues

### Quote error in objective name
When a mission or objective has the " character, you need to put another quote surrounding the word, for example:
```
...,"Harvest a Coyote, using the "Snakebite" Compound Bow.",...
```

Needs to be changed to

```
...,"Harvest a Coyote, using the ""Snakebite"" Compound Bow.",...
```
